# Who are you?


Hey! I’m Scott, from Scotland, and the best name I could come up with for this project is `ScotSec`!

I’m a 30-something who worked as an electrical engineer for over 10 years and as an operations technician for 6. This website was created to host my blog posts and thoughts from my journey towards becoming a penetration tester.

There is quite a difference between these careers, but I am hoping to leverage some common skills, such as problem-solving and critical thinking, to make the transition easier.


# What is your experience?


I have worked in various industries as an electrical engineer, including FMCG, brewing, and packaging. This involved everything from general planned and breakdown maintenance to programming and fault-finding on PLCs, as well as project work.

As an operations technician, I worked in Scotland’s only oil refinery, which was a top-tier COMAH site and considered critical national infrastructure. Its closure prompted me to pursue a career in penetration testing. In this role, I was responsible for the day-to-day operations of the refinery, control of work, creating and reviewing procedures, projects, and permits.

Though I was a long-time hobbyist, I started this journey with no formal IT or cybersecurity experience in January 2024. I hadn’t even used Linux before I started, so there was quite a learning curve. Hopefully, I can show that it is possible to start a career in penetration testing from scratch if you are willing to put in the time and effort while utilizing skills from previous roles.
