# Who are you?

Hey! I'm Scott, from Scotland and the best name I could come up with for this project is `Scotsec`! 

I'm a 30 something that worked as an electrical engineer for over 10 years and as an operations technician for 6. This website was created to host my blog posts and thoughts from my journey towards becoming a penetration tester. 

There is quite a difference in these careers but I am hoping to leverage some common skills between them such as problem solving and critial thinking to make the process easier.


# What is your experience?

I have worked in various industries as an electrical engineer such as FMCG, Brewing and packaging. This involved anything from general planned and breakdown maintainence to programing and fault finding on PLC's and even project work.

As an operations technician I worked in Scotlands only oil refinery which was a top tier COMAH site and considered critial national infrastructure, The closure of which sparked me to begin persuing a career in penetration testing. In this role I looked after the day to day operations of the refinery, control of work, creating and reviewing procedures, projects and permits.

Though I was a long time hobbiest I started this journey with no formal IT / Cyber security experience in January 2024, I hadn't even used Linux before I started so there was quite a learning curve. Hopefully I can show that it is possible to start a career in penetration testing from scratch if you are willing to put the time and effort in utilizing skills from my previous roles.
