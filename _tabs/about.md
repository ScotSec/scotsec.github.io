# About Me

I've worked as an electrical engineer/technician for over 10 years and this website was created to host my blog posts and thoughts from my journey towards becoming a penetration tester. 

There is quite a difference in these careers but I am hoping to leverage some common skills between them such as problem solving and critial thinking to make the process easier.

I started this journey with no formal IT / Cyber security experience in January 2024, I hadn't even used Linux before I started so there was quite a learning curb. Hopefully I can show that it is possible to start a career in penetration testing from scratch if you are willing to put the time and effort in.


If you found anything on this site interesting or you would like to get in contact with me please feel free to reach out.
